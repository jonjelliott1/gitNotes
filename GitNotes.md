# Jon Elliott's Git Notes

## Quick Actions - Step by Step

###  Steps to create a new repo and clone it on my local system.

1. Go to Github account. Create empty repo with Readme.md and license added.
2. Open Command Line
3. Go to Repos directory.
4. Type: git clone [url of repo from github]

### How to add a file
git add [file]

### Add all files
git add .

### How to commit
git commit -m "added my github name"

The  `-m`  flag is for the message (“added my github name”) on the commit - every commit needs a commit message. (2)

### How to see differences in files that are about to be pushed.
git status

### Push Changes to Github
git push origin [remote-Branch-Name]
("Origin" refers to the current branch you are working on on your local machine)

### Now how to merge sub branch to another branch
